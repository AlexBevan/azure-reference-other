> [!Note]
> **Applies to**:   Machine Learning Studio (classic)
>
> This content pertains only to Studio (classic). Similar drag and drop modules have been added to Azure Machine Learning
designer (preview). Learn more in [this article comparing the two versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio/what-is-ml-studio#compare).

> **New customers**: We recommend that all new customers start with [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/ui-concept-visual-interface) (preview), instead of Studio (classic). Both offer drag and drop modules to build and deploy machine learning workflows, but the designer provides scalability, version control, and enterprise security.
