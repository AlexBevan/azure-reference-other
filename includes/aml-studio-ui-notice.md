> [!TIP]
>
> **New customers**: We recommend that all new customers start with [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/ui-concept-visual-interface) (preview), instead of Studio (classic). Both offer drag and drop modules to build and deploy machine learning workflows, but the designer provides scalability, version control, and enterprise security.
