> [!TIP]
> We recommend that all **new customers** start with [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/ui-concept-visual-interface) (preview) instead of Studio (classic). While both offer drag-n-drop modules to build your machine learning models, only the designer provides scalability, version control, and enterprise security.
