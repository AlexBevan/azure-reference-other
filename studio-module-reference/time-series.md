# Time Series
This section describes the modules in Azure Machine Learning Studio that are specifically designed for working with time series data.  
    
 If you need help determining whether you need an algorithm specially for time series, or another type of algorithm, see these resources:

##  <a name="categories"></a> Time Series Modules  

Azure Machine Learning Studio provides the following modules for analyzing time series.   
  
|Module|  
|--------------|  
|[Time Series Anomaly Detection](time-series-anomaly-detection.md)|
 
Additionally, you can use the [Execute R Script](execute-r-script.md) and [Execute Python Script](execute-python-script.md) modules to perform custom time series analyses, using the R or Python languages.
