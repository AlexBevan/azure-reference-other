# OpenCV Library Modules
The Open Source Computer vision (OpenCV) Library is an open-source library that supports a variety of image processing and image recognition tasks. For more information, see [http://opencv.org/](http://opencv.org/).  
  
 The modules in this section provide a way for you to easily incorporate the OpenCV Library into your machine learning experiments in Azure Machine Learning Studio.  
  
 For additional image recognition features, see the image APIs published as part of [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services):  
  
-   [Face API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/face-api). Detect faces and analyze critical facial attributes, including emotion.  
  
-   [Computer Vision API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/computer-vision-api). Supports domain detection, identification of adult content, image tagging, and image type or color analysis.  
  
-   [Bing Image Search](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api). Get images for machine learning projects by searching by type, color, region, and other attributes.
