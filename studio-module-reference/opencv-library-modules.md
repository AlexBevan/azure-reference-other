# OpenCV Library Modules

This article describes the modules in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) that support use of the Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) Library. 

[!INCLUDE [studio-ui-applies-label](../includes/studio-ui-applies-label.md)]

OpenCV is an open-source library that supports a variety of image processing and image recognition tasks. For more information, see [the OpenCV website](https://opencv.org/).  

The modules in Machine Learning Studio (classic) provide a way for you to easily incorporate the OpenCV Library into your machine learning experiments.

For additional image recognition features, see the image APIs published as part of [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services):

- [Face API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/face-api). Detects faces and analyzes critical facial attributes, including emotion.

- [Computer Vision API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/computer-vision-api). Supports domain detection, identification of adult content, image tagging, and image type or color analysis.

- [Bing Image Search](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api). Gets images for machine learning projects by searching by type, color, region, and other attributes.

## List of modules

The OpenCV Library category includes these modules:

+ [Import Images](import-images.md): Loads images from Azure Blob storage into a dataset.

+ [Pretrained Cascade Image Classification](pretrained-cascade-image-classification.md): Creates a pretrained image classification model for frontal faces by using the OpenCV Library.
