# Evaluate Probability Function
*Fits a specified probability distribution function to a dataset*  
  
 Category: [Statistical Functions](statistical-functions.md)  
  
##  <a name="Remarks"></a> Module Overview  
 You can use the [Evaluate Probability Function](evaluate-probability-function.md) module to calculate statistical measures that describe a columnâ€™s distribution, such as the Bernoulli, Pareto, or Poisson distributions.  
  
 When you evaluate your data against a probability distribution, you are mapping column values against a set of values with known properties. By knowing whether your data corresponds to one of these well-known distributions, you might be able infer other properties of your data. In general, you can get better predictions from a model when you can identify the distribution that fits the data best.  
  
 The question of which probability distribution function to use depends on the data and the variables that are being measured. For example, some distributions are designed to describe probabilities of discrete values; others are intended for use only with continuous numerical variables.  For some distributions, you must also know in advance an expected mean, degrees of freedom, and so forth. For details, see [Supported Probability Distributions](#bkmk_SupportedDist).
  
 For all probability distributions, you can compute the cumulative distribution function (**cdf**), the inverse cumulative distribution function (**InverseCdf**), or the probability density function (**Pdf**).   
 
 The **Probability Function Evaluation** module requires a dataset that contains at least one column of numerical values as input. It returns a data table that contains the values computed by the specified probability function. Optionally, you can also return the original values from the analyzed columns.  


## How to Use [Evaluate Probability Function](evaluate-probability-function.md)  

 The options for this module change depending on the type of probability distribution you want to compute, and all other options will be reset if you change the probability  distribution method. Therefore, be sure to choose the **Distribution** option first.
 
 The module requires that you connect a dataset that contains numerical data types, and then select one or more columns to analyze, using a single probability distribution method.

If you want to analyze multiple columns with different methods, use a separate instance of the module for each probability distribution that you apply.
     
  
1. Add the [Evaluate Probability Function](evaluate-probability-function.md) module to your experiment. You can find this module in the [Statistical Functions](statistical-functions.md) group in the **experiment items** list in Azure Machine Learning Studio.  

2. Connect a dataset containing at least one column of numbers. 

3.  Use the **Distribution** option to select the kind of probability distribution that you want to calculate.  See [Supported Probability Distributions](#bkmk_SupportedDist) for a list of options and their required arguments.
  
4.  Set parameters as required by the distribution.  
  
5.  Choose one of three statistics to create:  

    -   Cumulative distribution function (**cdf**)
    
        Returns the probability for a compound event, defined as the sum of ocurrences when the random variable takes a value smaller than some specific value x. In other words, it answers the question: "How common are samples that are less than or equal to this value?"  This function can be used with both continuous and discrete numeric variables. 
  
    -   Inverse cumulative distribution function (**InverseCdf**)
    
        Returns the value associated with a specific cumulative probability (cdf). In other words, it answers the question: "What is the value of x at which the cdf function returns the cumulative probability y?" 
  
    -   Probability density function (**pdf**)
    
        Describes the relative likelihood for a random variable to be a specific value. In other words, it answers the question: "How common are samples at exactly this value?"
  
 6. Use the Column Selector to choose the columns over which to compute the selected probability distribution.
 
    + All the columns you select must have a numerical data type. 
    + The range of data in the column must also be valid, given the selected probability function. Otherwise, an error or NaN result may occur. 
    + For sparse columns, any values that correspond to background zeros will not be processed.  
 
7. Use the **Result mode** option to specify how to output the results. You can replace column values with the probability distribution values, append the new values to the dataset, or return only the probability distribution values.  
  
8. Run the experiment, or right-click the [Evaluate Probability Function](evaluate-probability-function.md) module and click **Run selected**.   

### Results

For example, the following table represents partial results, using the **Append** option, on a single temperature column (from the Forest Fires sample dataset). Note that the headings of the generated columns contain the probability distribution that was used.

|temp|StandardNormal.Cdf(temp)|StandardNormal.Pdf(temp)|FFisher.cdf(temp|FFisher.cdf(temp|
|------|------|------|------|------|
|8.2|1|1|0.984774|0.004349|
|18|1|1|0.997896|0.000311|
|14.6|1|1|0.996352|0.000648|
|8.3|1|1|0.985201|0.004187|
11.4|1|1|0.993147|0.001502|

You can also chart a simple cumulative distribution and probability density of any numeric column, without using the [Evaluate Probability Function](evaluate-probability-function.md) module. This chart might be helpful in determining which probability distribution is likely to suit your data. 
1. Right-click the dataset or module output, and select **Visualize**. 
2. Select the column of interest, and in the **Histogram** pane, select **cumulative distribution** or **probability density**. 
3. A chart of the distribution, like the following, is superimposed on the histogram representing the data.

##  <a name="Notes"></a> Technical Notes  
 This module supports all distributions that are provided in the open source MATH.NET Numerics library. For more information, see the documentation for the [Math.Net.Numerics.Distribution](http://numerics.mathdotnet.com/api/MathNet.Numerics.Distributions/index.htm) library.  
  
 Right-tailed and two-tailed distributions appear as separate distributions, not as parameterized versions of base distributions. The current behavior is to preserve compatibility with Excel.
