# Error 0075  
Exception occurs when an invalid binning function is used when quantizing a dataset.  
  
This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when you are trying to bin data using an unsupported method, or when the parameter combinations are invalid.  
  
## Resolution  

Error handling for this event was introduced in an earlier version of Azure Machine Learning that allowed more customization of binning methods. Currently all binning methods are based on a selection from a dropdown list, so technically it should no longer be possible to get this error.

If you get this error when using the [Group Data into Bins](../group-data-into-bins.md) module, consider reporting the issue in the [Azure Machine Learning forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=MachineLearning), providing the data types, parameter settings, and the exact error message.
