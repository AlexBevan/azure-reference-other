# Machine Learning - Initialize Model - Regression
**What is Regression?**  
  
 Regression algorithms are algorithms that learn to predict the value of a real function for a single instance of data. Regression algorithms can incorporate input from multiple features, by determining the contribution of each feature of the data to the regression function.  
  
 Once the regression algorithm has trained a function based on already labeled data, the function can be used to predict the label of a new (unlabeled) instance. For example, a housing price predictor might use a regression algorithm to predict the value of a particular house, based on historical data about regional house prices.
