# Text Analytics

This article describes the text analytics modules included in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic). These modules provide specialized computational tools for working with both structured and unstructured text, including:  

+ Multiple options for preprocessing text.
+ Language detection.
+ Creation of features from text using customizable n-gram dictionaries.
+ Feature hashing, to efficiently analyze text without preprocessing or advanced linguistic analysis.  
+ Vowpal Wabbit, for very fast machine learning on text. Vowpal Wabbit supports feature hashing, topic modeling (LDA), and classification.
+ Named entity recognition, to extract the names of people, places, and organizations from unstructured text.

## Examples

For examples of text analytics using Azure Machine Learning, see the [Azure AI Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai/):  

- [News categorization](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525167): Uses feature hashing to classify articles into a predefined list of categories.

- [Find similar companies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525164): Uses the text of Wikipedia articles to categorize companies.  
  
- [Text classification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525957): Demonstrates the end-to-end process of using text from Twitter messages in sentiment analysis (five-part sample).

##  List of modules

The **Text Analytics** category in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) includes these modules:

+ [Detect Languages](detect-languages.md): Detects the language of each line in the input file.  
+ [Extract Key Phrases from Text](extract-key-phrases-from-text.md): Extracts key phrases from given text.  
+ [Extract N-Gram Features from Text](extract-n-gram-features-from-text.md): Creates N-Gram dictionary features, and does feature selection on them.  
+ [Feature Hashing](feature-hashing.md): Converts text data to integer-encoded features by using the Vowpal Wabbit library.  
+ [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](latent-dirichlet-allocation.md): Performs topic modeling by using the Vowpal Wabbit library for LDA.  
+ [Named Entity Recognition](named-entity-recognition.md): Recognizes named entities in a text column.  
+ [Preprocess Text](preprocess-text.md): Performs cleaning operations on text.  
+ [Score Vowpal Wabbit 7-4 Model](score-vowpal-wabbit-version-7-4-model.md): Scores input from Azure by using version 7-4 of the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning system.  
+ [Score Vowpal Wabbit 7-10 Model](score-vowpal-wabbit-version-7-10-model.md): Scores input from Azure by using version 7-10 of the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning system.  
+ [Score Vowpal Wabbit 8 Model](score-vowpal-wabbit-version-8-model.md): Scores input from Azure by using version 8 of the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning system.  
+ [Train Vowpal Wabbit 7-4 Model](train-vowpal-wabbit-version-7-4-model.md): Trains a model by using version 7-4 of the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning system.  
+ [Train Vowpal Wabbit 7-10 Model](train-vowpal-wabbit-version-7-10-model.md): Trains a model by using version 7-10 of the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning system.  
+ [Train Vowpal Wabbit 8 Model](train-vowpal-wabbit-version-8-model.md): Trains a model by using version 8 of the Vowpal Wabbit machine learning system.
