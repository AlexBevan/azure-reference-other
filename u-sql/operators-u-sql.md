# Operators (U-SQL)
In addition to the built in C# functions and operators, U-SQL has added some built in operators that are commonly used in SQL-based languages.  The following is a list of the types of operators that U-SQL has added:  
  
|Operator|Description|
|------|------|
|[Arithmetic Operators](../USQL/arithmetic-operators-u-sql.md)|Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on two expressions of one or more of the data types of the numeric data type category.|
|[Comparison Operators](../USQL/comparison-operators-u-sql.md) |Comparison operators test whether two expressions are the same. |
|[Logical Operators](../USQL/logical-operators-u-sql.md)|Logical operators test for the truth of some condition. |
|[Other Operators](../USQL/other-operators-u-sql.md) |Other additional operators.|

These built-in scalar functions and operators can be used in the context of any U-SQL scalar expression intermingled with C# expressions. Some operators, like [OVER](../USQL/over-expression-u-sql.md) however have restrictions where they are allowed to be used.â€ƒ
