# PIVOT and UNPIVOT (U-SQL)
You can use the PIVOT and UNPIVOT relational operators to change a rowset  expression into another rowset. PIVOT rotates a rowset expression by turning the unique values from one column in the expression into multiple columns in the output, and performs aggregations where they are required on any remaining column values that are wanted in the final output. UNPIVOT performs the opposite operation to PIVOT by rotating columns of a rowset expression into column values.

The syntax for PIVOT provides is simpler and more readable than the syntax that may otherwise be specified in a complex series of SELECT statements.

<table><th align="left">Syntax</th><tr><td><pre>
Pivot_Expression :=

     ')'.<br />

### Semantics of Syntax Elements    
- <a name="als_row"></a>**`Aliased_Rowset`**    
  Aliased rowsets are rowsets that may or may not need a table alias.
  <table><th>Syntax</th><tr><td><pre>
  Aliased_Rowset :=                                                                                   
       Rowset [Alias]
  |    Rowset_Expression Alias.
  </pre></td></tr></table>
  
  - **`Alias`**  
    The rowset alias gives a name to the rowset that can be used in the remainder of the PIVOT expression to refer to that specific rowset. It can be a [quoted or unquoted identifier](u-sql-identifiers.md):
    <table><th>Syntax</th><tr><td><pre>
    Alias :=                                                                                       
         'AS' <a href="u-sql-identifiers.md">Quoted_or_Unquoted_Identifier</a>. 
    </pre></td></tr></table>
          
  - **`Rowset`**  
    The simplest rowset sources are a rowset variable such as `@rowset` that has been defined in a previous statement of the script and a table that has been created in the accountâ€™s catalog:
    <table><th>Syntax</th><tr><td><pre>
    Rowset :=                                                                                      
         Rowset_Variable
    |    Identifier.
    </pre></td></tr></table>
 
    A table can be referenced either with its fully 3-part qualified name, within the current database context with a 2-part name, or within the current database and schema context with a single-part name. Optionally, a table alias can be provided for an input rowset variable or table which then can be used in the remainder of the PIVOT expression.  
        
    Providing a rowset alias is optional.  
  
  - **`Rowset_Expression Alias`**  
    U-SQL also provides the ability to query over nested [query expressions](query-statements-and-expressions-u-sql.md), [table-valued function calls](u-sql-select-selecting-from-a-function-call.md) or querying [external rowsets](u-sql-select-selecting-from-an-external-rowset.md). Follow the links for more details on each.
        
    In these cases, a rowset alias has to be provided and cannot be left out.
    <table><th>Syntax</th><tr><td><pre>
    Rowset_Expression :=                                                                           
         '(' <a href="query-statements-and-expressions-u-sql.md">Query_Expression</a> ')'
    |    <a href="u-sql-select-selecting-from-a-function-call.md">Function_Call</a>
    |    <a href="u-sql-select-selecting-from-an-external-rowset.md">External_Rowset_Expression</a>.
    </pre></td></tr></table>  

- <a name="agg_func_call"></a>**`Aggregate_Function_Call`**  
Is a system or user-defined aggregate function that accepts one or more inputs. The aggregate function should be invariant to null values. An aggregate function invariant to null values does not consider null values in the group while it is evaluating the aggregate value.  Note that the Aggregate_Function_Call cannot contain `DISTINCT` aggregations. 

- <a name="col_ident"></a>**`Column_Identifier`**  
  The PIVOT expression can refer to column identifiers either by providing the quoted or unquoted identifier of the column, or by prepending the rowset/table alias or rowset variable name to identify the rowset to which the column belongs.   
  <table><th>Syntax</th><tr><td><pre>
  Column_Identifier :=                                                                                
       [(Rowset_Variable | <a href="u-sql-identifiers.md">Quoted_or_Unquoted_Identifier</a>) '.']
       <a href="u-sql-identifiers.md">Quoted_or_Unquoted_Identifier</a>.
  </pre></td></tr></table>

- <a name="col_alias"></a>**`Column_Alias`**  
  The column alias gives a name to the column that can be used in the remainder of the PIVOT expression to refer to that specific column. It can be a [quoted or unquoted identifier](u-sql-identifiers.md):
  <table><th>Syntax</th><tr><td><pre>
  Column_Alias :=                                                                                     
       'AS' <a href="u-sql-identifiers.md">Quoted_or_Unquoted_Identifier</a>.
  </pre></td></tr></table>
    
### Examples
- The examples can be executed in Visual Studio with the [Azure Data Lake Tools plug-in](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49504).  
- The scripts can be executed [locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-data-lake-tools-get-started#run-u-sql-locally).  An Azure subscription and Azure Data Lake Analytics account is not needed when executed locally.

**Basic PIVOT Example**<a name="pivot_basic"></a>   
The example below repros "Basic PIVOT Example" from [Using PIVOT and UNPIVOT](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot) in SQL Server.  To execute the example with the same data set, simply bcp or copy and paste `DaysToManufacture` and `StandardCost` from AdventureWorks2014.Production.Product to a local text file.  The same data set appears in at least [AdventureWorks2016](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49502).  An alternative solution using MAP_GG can be viewed at [PIVOT and MAP_AGG](map-agg-u-sql.md#pivot_basic)
```sql
// Using a data file created from a bcp export
@products =
     EXTRACT DaysToManufacture  int,
             StandardCost       double
     FROM "/ReferenceGuide/bcp/Production_Product.bcp"
     USING Extractors.Tsv();

// optional
@output =
    SELECT DaysToManufacture,
           AVG(StandardCost) AS AverageCost
    FROM @products
    GROUP BY DaysToManufacture;
