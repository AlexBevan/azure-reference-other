# Other Simple Built-In Types and Literals
U-SQLâ€™s also supports the following simple built-in types:  
```
bool       bool?  
Guid       Guid?  
byte[]  
```
The grammar rules use `Other_Type` to refer to one of these types.  
  
The maximal size of a column of type `byte[]` is the same as the maximal size of a row which currently is 4MB.  
  
The built-in type `bool` uses the standard C# literals `true` and `false`.  
  
The built-in type `Guid` does not have a built-in literal form, but requires the standard C# construction mechanisms such as `Guid.Parse()` or new `Guid()`. Note that these constructions with simple string parameters are constant folded (executed at compile time) and thus are similar to a built-in literal.  
  
The built-in type `byte[]` does not have a built-in literal form, but accepts the standard C# construction `new byte[] {}` as a constant-foldable constructor.
