# Other Operators (U-SQL)
U-SQL provides other additional operators that are not part of the C# family of operators and do not fit into the other categories of [C# Functions and Operators](../u-sql/csharp-functions-and-operators-u-sql.md). 

Currently these operators are: 
* [CSHARP](../u-sql/csharp-u-sql.md)
