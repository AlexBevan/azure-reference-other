# U-SQL Table Types
U-SQL also supports specifying types that represent composite rowset - or table - types. These types are often anonymous, for example when defining a table, but can also be named with the [CREATE TYPE](create-type-u-sql.md) statement and then referenced in U-SQL [table-valued function](u-sql-table-valued-functions.md) and [procedure](u-sql-procedures.md) definitions.
