# U-SQL Table Types
U-SQL also supports specifying types that represent composite rowset - or table - types. These types are often anonymous, for example when defining a table, but can also be named with the [CREATE TYPE](../USQL/create-type-u-sql.md) statement and then referenced in U-SQL [table-valued function](../USQL/u-sql-table-valued-functions.md) and [procedure](../USQL/u-sql-procedures.md) definitions.
