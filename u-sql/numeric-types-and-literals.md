# Numeric Types and Literals
U-SQLâ€™s built-in numeric types are:
```
byte       byte?  
sbyte      sbyte?  
int        int?   
uint       uint?  
long       long?  
ulong      ulong?  
float      float?  
double     double?  
decimal    decimal?  
short      short?  
ushort     ushort?  
```
The grammar rules use Numeric_Type to refer to one of these types.  
  
They follow the C# rules regarding ranges and how they treat literals. For more information see [Types (C# Reference)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3ewxz6et.aspx).
