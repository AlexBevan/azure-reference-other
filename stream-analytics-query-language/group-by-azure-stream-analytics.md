# GROUP BY (Azure Stream Analytics)
  Groups a selected set of rows into a set of summary rows by the values of one or more columns or expressions. One row is returned for each group. Aggregate functions in the SELECT clauseâ€™s \<select> list provide information about each group instead of individual rows.  
  
 **Syntax**  
  
```  
GROUP BY <group by spec>  
  
<group by spec> ::=  
    <group by item> [ ,...n ]  
    | <window_type> | System.Timestamp  
  
<group by item> ::=  
    <column_expression>  
  
```  
  
 Either <window_type> or System.Timestamp is required, \<group by item> is optional.  <window_type> and a sequence of \<group by items> can appear in any order.  
  
## Arguments  
 **<window_type>**  
  
 Specifies any Azure Stream Analytics supported Windowing. See [Windowing &#40;Azure Stream Analytics&#41;](windowing-azure-stream-analytics.md).  
  
 **\< column_expression >**  
  
 Is the expression or the name of the column on which the grouping operation is performed.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
SELECT TollId, System.Timestamp AS WinEndTime, COUNT(*)   
FROM TollTagEntry TIMESTAMP BY EntryTime  
GROUP BY TumblingWindow( minute , 3 ) , TollId  
```
