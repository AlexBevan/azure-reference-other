# Supported metrics for Microsoft.Web/sites  
<!-- Data source : naam-->


The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Web/sites resource type.

  

**Table headings**
  
**Metric** - Metric display name follows by a description of the metric. The displayname appears in the Azure portal.  
**Name** - The name of the metric as referred to in the REST API.  
**Unit** - The default units used for the metric.  
**Aggregation** - The default aggregation type for this metric. Valid values: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Total, Count.  
**Dimensions** - Dimensions available. For more information, see (link to dimensions information).  
**DS Export**- Whether the metric is exportable to Azure Monitor Logs via Diagnostic Settings.  You can access all metrics via the REST API.
