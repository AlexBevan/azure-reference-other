|Metric|Name|Unit|Aggregation|Dimensions|Time Grains|DS Export|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Application Gateway Total Time<p><p>Time that it takes for a request to be processed and its response to be sent. This is the interval from the time when Application Gateway receives the first byte of an HTTP request to the time when the response send operation finishes. It's important to note that this usually includes the Application Gateway processing time, time that the request and response packets are traveling over the network and the time the backend server took to respond. |`ApplicationGatewayTotalTime` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |Listener|PT1M |No|
|Requests per minute per Healthy Host<p><p>Average request count per minute per healthy backend host in a pool |`AvgRequestCountPerHealthyHost` |Count |Average |BackendSettingsPool|PT1M |No|
|WAF Bot Protection Matches<p><p>Matched Bot Rules |`AzwafBotProtection` |Count |Total |Action, Category, Mode, CountryCode, PolicyName, PolicyScope|PT1M |Yes|
|WAF Custom Rule Matches<p><p>Matched Custom Rules |`AzwafCustomRule` |Count |Total |Action, CustomRuleID, Mode, CountryCode, PolicyName, PolicyScope|PT1M |Yes|
|WAF Managed Rule Matches<p><p>Matched Managed Rules |`AzwafSecRule` |Count |Total |Action, Mode, RuleGroupID, RuleID, CountryCode, PolicyName, PolicyScope, RuleSetName|PT1M |Yes|
|WAF Total Requests<p><p>Total number of requests evaluated by WAF |`AzwafTotalRequests` |Count |Total |Action, CountryCode, Method, Mode, PolicyName, PolicyScope|PT1M |Yes|
|Backend Connect Time<p><p>Time spent establishing a connection with a backend server |`BackendConnectTime` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |Listener, BackendServer, BackendPool, BackendHttpSetting|PT1M |No|
|Backend First Byte Response Time<p><p>Time interval between start of establishing a connection to backend server and receiving the first byte of the response header, approximating processing time of backend server |`BackendFirstByteResponseTime` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |Listener, BackendServer, BackendPool, BackendHttpSetting|PT1M |No|
|Backend Last Byte Response Time<p><p>Time interval between start of establishing a connection to backend server and receiving the last byte of the response body |`BackendLastByteResponseTime` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |Listener, BackendServer, BackendPool, BackendHttpSetting|PT1M |No|
|Backend Response Status<p><p>The number of HTTP response codes generated by the backend members. This does not include any response codes generated by the Application Gateway. |`BackendResponseStatus` |Count |Total |BackendServer, BackendPool, BackendHttpSetting, HttpStatusGroup|PT1M |Yes|
|Web Application Firewall Blocked Requests Rule Distribution<p><p>Web Application Firewall blocked requests rule distribution |`BlockedCount` |Count |Total |RuleGroup, RuleId|PT1M |Yes|
|Bytes Received<p><p>The total number of bytes received by the Application Gateway from the clients |`BytesReceived` |Bytes |Total |Listener|PT1M |Yes|
|Bytes Sent<p><p>The total number of bytes sent by the Application Gateway to the clients |`BytesSent` |Bytes |Total |Listener|PT1M |Yes|
|Current Capacity Units<p><p>Capacity Units consumed |`CapacityUnits` |Count |Average |No Dimensions|PT1M |No|
|Client RTT<p><p>Round trip time between clients and Application Gateway. This metric indicates how long it takes to establish connections and return acknowledgements |`ClientRtt` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |Listener|PT1M |No|
|Current Compute Units<p><p>Compute Units consumed |`ComputeUnits` |Count |Average |No Dimensions|PT1M |No|
|CPU Utilization<p><p>Current CPU utilization of the Application Gateway |`CpuUtilization` |Percent |Average |No Dimensions|PT1M |No|
|Current Connections<p><p>Count of current connections established with Application Gateway |`CurrentConnections` |Count |Total |No Dimensions|PT1M |Yes|
|Estimated Billed Capacity Units<p><p>Estimated capacity units that will be charged |`EstimatedBilledCapacityUnits` |Count |Average |No Dimensions|PT1M |No|
|Failed Requests<p><p>Count of failed requests that Application Gateway has served |`FailedRequests` |Count |Total |BackendSettingsPool|PT1M |Yes|
