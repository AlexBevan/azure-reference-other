# DataTransferOperations

Logs generated by Azure Data Transfer as objects are transferred. These logs can be used to determine if an object has successfully transferred, failed to transfer, or is in the process of transferring. A typical use case would be an objects latest status of 'InTransit' indicating that the object is still transferring and no action needs to be taken.
