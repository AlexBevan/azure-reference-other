# UCDeviceAlert

 Update Compliance - These alerts are activated as a result of an issue that is device-specific, and is not specific to a specific update and a specific device. Like UpdateAlerts, the AlertType indicates where the Alert comes from (ServiceDeviceAlert, ClientDeviceAlert). For example, an EndOfService alert is a ClientDeviceAlert, as the fact it is on a build no longer being serviced (EOS) is a client-wide state. Meanwhile, DeviceRegistrationIssues in WUfB DS will be a ServiceDeviceAlert, as it is a device-wide state in the service to not be correctly registered.
