# ASimDnsActivityLogs

 The ASim DNS activity schema represents DNS protocol activity, which may be logged either by a DNS server or by a device sending DNS requests to a DNS server. The DNS protocol activity includes DNS queries, DNS server updates, and DNS bulk data transfers. Since the schema represents protocol activity, it is governed by RFCs and officially assigned parameter lists. The DNS activity schema does not represent DNS server audit events.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AdditionalFields | dynamic | Additional information, represented using key/value pairs provided by the source which do not map to ASim. |
| DnsFlagsAuthenticated | bool | The DNS authenticated answer flag, which is related to DNSSEC, indicates in a response that all data included in the answer and authority sections of the response have been verified by the server according to the policies of that server. see RFC 3655 Section 6.1 for more information. |
| DnsFlagsAuthoritative | bool | The DNS authoritative answer flag indicates whether the response from the server was authoritative. |
| DnsFlagsCheckingDisabled | bool | The DNS CD flag, which is related to DNSSEC, indicates in a query that non-verified data is acceptable to the system sending the query. |
| DnsFlagsRecursionAvailable | bool | The DNS RA flag indicates in a response that that server supports recursive queries. |
| DnsFlagsRecursionDesired | bool | The DNS recursion desired flag indicates in a request that that client would like the server to use recursive queries. |
| DnsFlagsTruncates | bool | The DNS TC flag indicates that a response was truncates as it exceeded the maximum response size. |
