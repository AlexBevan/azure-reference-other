# GCPAuditLogs

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) audit logs, ingested from Sentinel's connector, enable you to capture three types of audit logs: admin activity logs, data access logs, and access transparency logs. Google cloud audit Logs record a trail that practitioners can use to monitor access and detect potential threats across Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources.
