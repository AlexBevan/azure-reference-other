# UCUpdateAlert

 Update Compliance - Alert for both Client and Service Update, will contain information that needs attention, relative to one device (client), one update, and one deployment (if relevant). Certain fields may be blank depending on the UpdateAlert's AlertType field; for example, ServiceUpdateAlert will not necessarily contain client-side statuses.
