# AmlOnlineEndpointTrafficLog

 Traffic logs for AzureML (machine learning) online endpoints. The table could be used to check the detailed information of the request to an online endpoint. For example, you could use it to check the request duration, the request failure reason, etc.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AzureMLWorkspaceId | string | The machine learning workspace ID of the online endpoint. |
| DeploymentName | string | The name of the online deployment. |
| EndpointName | string | The name of the online endpoint. |
| Location | string | The region of the online endpoint. |
| Method | string | The requested method from client. |

| Protocol | string | The protocol of the request. |
| RequestDurationMs | int | Duration in milliseconds from the request start time to the last byte of the request received from the user client. |
| RequestPayloadSize | int | The total bytes received from the user client. |
| RequestThrottlingDelayMs | int | Delay in milliseconds in request data transfer due to network throttling. |
| _ResourceId | string | A unique identifier for the resource that the record is associated with |
| ResponseCode | int | The final response code returned to the user. |
